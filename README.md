# Few-Sample-Feature-Selection-via-Feature-Manifold-Learning
We propose a new method for few-
sample supervised feature selection (FS). Our
method first learns the manifold of the feature
space of each class using kernels capturing multi-
feature associations. Then, based on Rieman-
nian geometry, a composite kernel is computed,
extracting the differences between the learned
feature associations. Finally, a FS score based
on spectral analysis is computed.
